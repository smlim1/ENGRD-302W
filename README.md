# Tuition Affordability and Student Implications

## Project Intro/Objective
The rising cost of tuition in the United States has far outpaced household income growth, raising concerns about the affordability and accessibility of higher education. To address this issue, our exploratory data analysis (EDA) leverages the College Scorecard dataset to assess how well institutions prepare students for postgraduate success, particularly in terms of earnings. Our research examines key variables related to tuition affordability and its impact on postgraduate outcomes.

## Project Description
Our main areas of focus are as follows:
How does affordability impact access to education?
How does affordability influence student success in college?
What role does financial aid play in postgraduate employment?

Our study focuses on U.S. higher education institutions from 2008 to 2019 and includes variables such as institutional type, graduation and retention rates, tuition revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) student, admission rates, the proportion of graduates with federal loans, and median earnings ten years post-enrollment. We explored the relationships between financial aid, earnings, tuition costs, and admission rate using linear regression. 

Challenges: We accounted for confounders like institutional location, elite status, and program types (medicine, engineering), given their significant influence on post-graduate earnings. We were limited to the variables of the dataset. As such, we were not able to research more about factors that determined the amount of financial aid and limits on educational attainment. 

Next Steps: We would like to explore additional factors that may contribute to tuition costs and affordability by examining different sources. Specifically, we may consider fees outside of tuition such as housing, transportation, and book costs.
